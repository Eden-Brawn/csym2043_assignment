            <p>I am a parent, lecturer and have been a PhD student, so, it is safe to say that I know what a busy life is. I discovered yoga 20 years ago, and it has greatly improved my wellbeing, even to today through my busy lifestyle. On top of that I am a qualified yoga instructor meaning that my classes are high quality. 
                <br>
                Recent times have been tough and I persoanlly have been furthering my yoga experience by also practising wellbeing techniques and activities. So, because of these tough times I want to support workers in a corporate enviroments by improving their wellbeing, this will allow them to better deal with stress, as I have been doing myself. 
                <br>
                So through yoga and wellbeing related activities I aim to support corporate workers.</p>
